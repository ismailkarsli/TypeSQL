# @typesql/language-server

## 0.0.7

### Patch Changes

- Treat a completion request without a result as TypeScript's null instead of failing, so Neovim configs that drop a nil result still get TypeSQL completions.

- Log which TypeScript version was found when the project's TypeScript is too old for completions, instead of "no TypeScript 7.1 package found".

- Complete SQL in core's createSql(dialect).withPlugin(…), after ${sql.param("x")} and after a /* sql */ marker; escape quoted names inserted into "…" and '…' strings; and complete columns after an escaped \"Quoted\" table.

## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- Resolves packages and completion schemas afresh without caching their results.

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- Adds SQLite. `createSql<DB>(sqlite)` from `@typesql/core/sqlite` types SQLite statements with SQLite's grammar, type affinity, nullability and result column names, and `migrations()` derives the schema from SQLite DDL. Schemas can declare functions (`$functions`, `Sig`, an augmentable `FunctionCatalog`), JSON documents (`Json<T>`), literal-typed columns (`Typed<"text", T>`) and `Col` flags for column position, `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, generated and hidden columns; a misspelled table, column or function suggests the closest name, and the type cache serves SQLite statements too. The new `@typesql/sqlite` package runs queries on node:sqlite, better-sqlite3 and bun:sqlite (`createSql<DB>(db)`, savepoint transactions, `{ bigint: true }`, `migrate(db, m)`). The Kysely, Drizzle and Prisma packages accept `createSql(sqlite, db)`, converting their SQLite schemas (`FromKyselySqlite`, `FromDrizzleSqlite`, `FromPrismaSqlite`, `PrismaSqliteTypeMap`), and the `typesql-prisma` generator writes a SQLite schema for the `sqlite` provider. Editor completions work in SQLite statements. Breaking: the `typesql` command moves from `@typesql/pg` to the new `@typesql/cli`, where `typesql introspect --dialect postgres|sqlite` reads a PostgreSQL database (the default) or a SQLite file (`--db app.db`); `@typesql/pg/introspect` and `@typesql/sqlite/introspect` export the introspection and `main`. The `sql` function, projections and write helpers are now shared by all dialects: `Dialect` gains `valuesDefault` (`sql.values()` throws instead of writing `DEFAULT` without it), and `@typesql/core/adapter` adds `positional`, `splitParams`, `paramNumbers` and `sqliteValue` for drivers that bind positional parameters.
